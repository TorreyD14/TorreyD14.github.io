        I am 5th-year Senior here at the University of Missouri and I will be graduating with a Degree in Bachelors 
        of General Studies with emphasis’ in Information Technology, Psychology, and Business; in addition to a 
        Multicultural Certificate, Media Technology Design Certificate, and an Information Systems Certificate. I have 
        held several positions of leadership on campus in organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers, 
        United Ambassadors Diversity Recruitment Team, THRIVE Student Community of Practice, the Legion of Black 
        Collegians, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and University of Missouri National Pan-Hellenic Council. As you 
        can see I have had my hand in a lot of different areas, thus showing even if I personally may not know something 
        I can ask someone in one my networks for suggestions and answers. I have a thirst for knowledge and an even more 
        intense drive to helping others and I strive to add to both of those each day.
