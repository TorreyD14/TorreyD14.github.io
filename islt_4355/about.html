        Throughout my time here at Mizzou there has been lots I have explored both physically, mentally, socially, 
        and figuratively. The knowledge I’ve gained didn’t come naturally and it took a lot of networking to learn 
        the things I do now. I’ve missed out on a lot, even nearing the end of my 5th year of school there are 
        different communities and areas of both campus and Columbia as a whole, that I have yet to see for myself 
        and I would hate for others to be without the knowledge and opportunities to make their experience as best 
        as it can be. I want to give people the opportunity to have a much more centralized and reliably informative 
        source to find the org or business for themselves. The site will feature black student business, things to do 
        and places to go around Columbia, black student organizations, and other campus-related resources that students 
        may not know about if they haven’t been told about it.

            I am 5th-year Senior here at the University of Missouri and I will be graduating with a Degree in Bachelors 
            of General Studies with emphasis’ in Information Technology, Psychology, and Business; in addition to a 
            Multicultural Certificate, Media Technology Design Certificate, and an Information Systems Certificate. I have 
            held several positions of leadership on campus in organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers, 
            United Ambassadors Diversity Recruitment Team, THRIVE Student Community of Practice, the Legion of Black 
            Collegians, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and University of Missouri National Pan-Hellenic Council. As you 
            can see I have had my hand in a lot of different areas, thus showing even if I personally may not know something 
            I can ask someone in one my networks for suggestions and answers. I have a thirst for knowledge and an even more 
            intense drive to helping others and I strive to add to both of those each day.
