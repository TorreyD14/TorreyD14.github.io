                Throughout my time here at Mizzou there has been lots I have explored both physically, mentally, 
                socially, and figuratively. The knowledge I’ve gained didn’t come naturally and it took a lot of 
                networking to learn the things I do now. I’ve missed out on a lot, even nearing the end of my 5th 
                year of school there are different communities and areas of both campus and Columbia as a whole, 
                that I have yet to see for myself and I would hate for others to be without the knowledge and 
                opportunities to make their experience as best as it can be.
                <br>
                The goal of this is to give people the opportunity to have a much more centralized and reliably 
                informative source to find the org or business for themselves. The site will feature black student 
                business, things to do and places to go around Columbia, black student organizations, and other 
                campus-related resources that students may not know about if they haven’t been told about it.
