        The first section will be Businesses, and the subsections will be divided into: Local businesses, Franchises, 
        Black businesses, and Student businesses. The goal of this section will be to help show the viewer that there are
        surprisingly a lot more places to buy things and get serviced from than you may initially think when you first get 
        to Columbia. There are many benefits to supporting businesses that don’t have as much advertising as many of the 
        franchise level companies that enhance the communities you live in while here. Just in general, however, it is 
        good to have the option to know where you can figure out where to go, thus making your experience just that much 
        better and easier to adjust.

        The second section would be focused on organizations, and the subsections would be divided into: Black orgs, other 
        underrepresented demographic-related orgs, and a link to whatever website that Mizzou has detailing all recognized 
        organizations. One of the most common reasons students leave college, especially this University, is because they 
        weren’t involved, nor found their “place” or community while in school. While some may say, “why make it about 
        race?”, it is especially imperative that you tailor the information you give out towards whatever demographic you 
        are in front of. This tremendously helps someone on their journey finding their own niche. But even in general, 
        having a dedicated list that students can look at and even use to find more information and contact from really 
        helps a lot more than a tour guide briefly mentioning the title of a just a few organizations they may have heard 
        of.

        The last section would be the smallest section with it being based on Resources, this could be divided into: Campus 
        resources, and then other community resources/events/recreation that you don’t exactly have to spend money on. 
        Along with not having a sense of belonging within student organizations, a great way to help a student feel more 
        “at home” would be utilizing resources on campus directly tailored to one’s own identity, and even possibly exploring 
        others to expand knowledge and respect of people who identify different than yourself. There are many resources and 
        events around Columbia that many people may not know about such as Planned Parenthood, Dog Parks, DMV/Licensing offices, 
        and even a few very detailed drive-in Christmas light shows around.
