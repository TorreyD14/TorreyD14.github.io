    <p>
        I am choosing to do an “educational” website because a friend and I have been talking 
        about doing something like this for a long time, and it’s actually something that 
        could be used outside of this class which makes it more motivating to actually 
        complete my homework. The goals of this is to give people the opportunity to have a 
        much more centralized and reliably informative source to find the org or business for 
        themselves. The intended audience will start off with black students essentially. The 
        site will have black student business, things to do and places to go around Columbia, 
        black student organizations, and other campus-related resources that students may not 
        know about if they haven’t been told about it.
