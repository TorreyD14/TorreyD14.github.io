    <h3>This first section will be Businesses</h3>
    <p>
        The subsections will be divided into: Local businesses, Franchises, Black businesses, and Student businesses.
        The goal of this section will be to help show the viewer that there are surprisingly a lot more places to buy 
        things and get serviced from than you may initially think when you first get to Columbia. There are many 
        benefits to supporting businesses that don’t have as much advertising as many of the franchise level companies 
        that enhance the communities you live in while here. Just in general, however, it is good to have the option 
        to know where you can figure out where to go, thus making your experience just that much better and easier to 
        adjust.

    <h3>This section will be Organizations</h3>
    <p>
        The subsections would be divided into: Black orgs, other underrepresented demographic-related orgs, and a link 
        to whatever website that Mizzou has detailing all recognized organizations. One of the most common reasons 
        students leave college, especially this University, is because they weren’t involved, nor found their “place” 
        or community while in school. While some may say, “why make it about race?”, it is especially imperative that 
        you tailor the information you give out towards whatever demographic you are in front of. This tremendously 
        helps someone on their journey finding their own niche. But even in general, having a dedicated list that 
        students can look at and even use to find more information and contact from really helps a lot more than a tour 
        guide briefly mentioning the title of a just a few organizations they may have heard of.

    </p>

    <h3>This section will be Resources</h3>

    <p>
        This could be divided into: Campus resources, and then other community resources/events/recreation that you 
        don’t exactly have to spend money on. Along with not having a sense of belonging within student organizations, 
        a great way to help a student feel more “at home” would be utilizing resources on campus directly tailored to 
        one’s own identity, and even possibly exploring others to expand knowledge and respect of people who identify 
        different than yourself. There are many resources and events around Columbia that many people may not know about 
        such as Planned Parenthood, Dog Parks, DMV/Licensing offices, and even a few very detailed drive-in Christmas 
        light shows around.
